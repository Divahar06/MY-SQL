MySQL Data Analysis with "car_dekho" Database
This README provides an overview of the work done in MySQL using the "car_dekho" database. The database contains information about cars, and various queries were performed to gain insights and analyze the data.

Introduction
This project involved working with the "car_dekho" database in MySQL to explore and analyze car-related data. The queries executed provided valuable information and allowed for insights into various aspects of the dataset.

Queries and Analysis
Data Exploration:

Basic database setup was performed by creating the "cars" database and setting it as the default schema.
The "car_dekho" table within the "cars" database was used as the primary data source.
Query Examples:

Several queries were conducted on the "car_dekho" table to derive meaningful insights:

Counting total records in the table.
Determining the number of cars in specific years (2023, 2020-2022).
Identifying the year with the highest car count.
Exploring distinct fuel types.
Calculating the count of diesel and petrol cars in specific years.
Transforming the "mileage" column into numerical and unit parts.
Analyzing car counts based on year and fuel type.
Finding years with a significant number of "petrol" cars.
Filtering cars based on specific years.
Identifying cars with maximum and minimum selling prices.
Calculating the average kilometers driven in a specific year (e.g., 2020).
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to effectively utilize SQL queries to explore and analyze data within the "car_dekho" database. The provided queries offer insights into car trends, fuel types, and other key aspects of the dataset. This README serves as a reference for understanding the analysis conducted and provides a foundation for further exploration and customization.
